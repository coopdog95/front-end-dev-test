## Questions

<em>1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)</em>

I only needed to use basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this website. With the help of Bootstrap (specifically MDBootstrap), I was able to utilize many helpful components such as the grid system, carousel, and modern-looking, animated buttons.

<em>2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose </em>

The hardest part of this project (and most other front end projects I’ve done) was making sure the layout would be clean and error free when transitioning from desktop to mobile. Some issues I had to overcome included general spacing and making sure the  components following Bootstrap’s grid column structure would adjust correctly when transitioning to mobile.

<em>3. What you enjoyed the most and why </em>

Although I struggled with the transition from desktop to mobile, I did enjoy digging into each individual bug I had and diagnosing them by looking over my code and using the browser inspector.
